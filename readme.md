# Phage Directory v2

This is the Phage Directory core project. 
Transition project from static site (Middleman) to web app using Vue/Nuxt and powered by Airtable as a CMS.

### 7/12/2019
Sunsetting v2 for v3, going forward this version will be for reference and won't be maintained anymore.
The legacy site can be found at https://v2.phagedirectory.surge.sh

## Running Locally

Check out `package.json` for commands. This is a basic mirror of how Nuxt works.
Don't forget to use a newer npm: `nvm use 8.11.2`

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
